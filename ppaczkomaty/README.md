The application is written from scratch with Python 3.x and unittest. The project does not expose real functionality, all code examples can be ran with tests.

## Tests
Tests can be run with shell command: `run_tests.sh` or simply by calling python directly, for example: `python -m unittest tests/box_test.py`
